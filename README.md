---------------------------------------------Monek Payment Plugin for VirtueMart and Joomla------------------------------------------------------------------

****************************************************************************************************************************************

This is for Joomla 3+ as well as VirtueMart 3+.

It will not install on previous versions of Joomla and VirtueMart.

******************************************************************************************************************************************

Copy the contents of the "module" folder into the /tmp folder in your joomla root.

Log into the administrator side of Joomla and click on "Extensions" select "Manage" then click on "Install".

Use the "Install from folder" method and type in the path to the /tmp folder. For example: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\joomla3.8.6\tmp. Click "Check and Install".

This should install the Monek plugin and the Secure Hosting option should now appear in the "Payment Method" drop down when you create a new payment method in Joomla.

When setting up a new payment option in Joomla, click on the configuration tab and dont forget to enter the SH code and the check code for the customer along with the name of the template file you have uploaded to your SH account.

This is all you need to do and the next time you run through the front end checkout system your new secure hosting payment option should be available.
